## Intro

Welcome to Your Birthday Page, MSc H. Ren [1]

Congrats! You found this page that is dedicated to you! The author might be super happy...? If you are here for the passcode, please read through the page.

## Background

It's a long story.

## Methodology

The passcode to continue the little script is your official birthday (8 bits: yyyy/mm/dd) plus my birthday! Please do not consider the lunar calendar :-)

If you make it right, you may continue with the script. 

## Experiments & Results

Trust me, I coded the whole thing, and I tried it on Windows 11. It should also work on Windows 10. If not, contact the supporting staff via WeChat.

## Conclusion

Find more from the script. It is waiting for you.
